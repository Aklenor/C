DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This program is used to set various user preference options of the display.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ddiissppllaayy _d_i_s_p_l_a_y
               This option specifies the server to use; see _X_(_7_).

       bb       The bb option controls bell volume, pitch and duration.  This option accepts  up
               to  three numerical parameters, a preceding dash(-), or a 'on/off' flag.  If no
               parameters are given, or the 'on' flag is used, the  system  defaults  will  be
               used.   If  the  dash or 'off' are given, the bell will be turned off.  If only
               one numerical parameter is given, the bell volume will be set to that value, as
               a  percentage  of its maximum.  Likewise, the second numerical parameter speci‐
               fies the bell pitch, in hertz, and the third numerical parameter specifies  the
               duration in milliseconds.  Note that not all hardware can vary the bell charac‐
               teristics.  The X server will set the characteristics of the bell as closely as
               it can to the user's specifications.

       bbcc      The  bbcc  option  controls  _b_u_g _c_o_m_p_a_t_i_b_i_l_i_t_y mode in the server, if possible; a
               preceding dash(-) disables the mode, otherwise the mode  is  enabled.   Various
               pre-R4  clients  pass  illegal  values  in  some  protocol requests, and pre-R4
               servers did not correctly generate errors in these cases.  Such  clients,  when
               run  against an R4 server, will terminate abnormally or otherwise fail to oper‐
               ate correctly.  Bug compatibility mode  explicitly  reintroduces  certain  bugs
               into  the  X  server,  so  that  many such clients can still be run.  This mode
               should be used with care; new application development should be done with  this
               mode disabled.  The server must support the MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD protocol ex‐
               tension in order for this option to work.

       cc       The cc option controls key click.  This option can take  an  optional  value,  a
               preceding  dash(-),  or  an 'on/off' flag.  If no parameter or the 'on' flag is
               given, the system defaults will be used. If the dash or  'off'  flag  is  used,
               keyclick  will  be  disabled.  If a value from 0 to 100 is given, it is used to
               indicate volume, as a percentage of the maximum.  The X  server  will  set  the
               volume to the nearest value that the hardware can support.

       --ddppmmss   The --ddppmmss option disables DPMS (Energy Star) features.

       ++ddppmmss   The ++ddppmmss option enables DPMS (Energy Star) features.

       ddppmmss _f_l_a_g_s_._._.
               The ddppmmss option allows the DPMS (Energy Star) parameters to be set.  The option
               can take up to three numerical values, or the `force' flag followed by  a  DPMS
               state.   The  `force' flags forces the server to immediately switch to the DPMS
               state specified.  The DPMS state can be one of `standby', `suspend', `off',  or
               `on'.   When  numerical  values  are  given, they set the inactivity period (in
               units of seconds) before the three modes are activated.  The first value  given
               is  for the `standby' mode, the second is for the `suspend' mode, and the third
               is for the `off' mode.  Setting these values implicitly enables the  DPMS  fea‐
               tures.  A value of zero disables a particular mode.

       ffpp== _p_a_t_h_,_._._.
               The  ffpp== sets the font path to the entries given in the path argument.  The en‐
               tries are interpreted by the server, not by the client.  Typically they are di‐
               rectory names or font server names, but the interpretation is server-dependent.

       ffpp ddeeffaauulltt
               The ddeeffaauulltt argument causes the font path to be reset to the server's default.

       ffpp rreehhaasshh
               The  rreehhaasshh  argument  resets  the  font path to its current value, causing the
               server to reread the font databases in the current font path.  This  is  gener‐
               ally only used when adding new fonts to a font directory (after running _m_k_f_o_n_t_‐
               _d_i_r to recreate the font database).

       --ffpp or ffpp--
               The --ffpp and ffpp-- options remove elements from the current font path.  They  must
               be followed by a comma-separated list of entries.

       ++ffpp or ffpp++
               This  ++ffpp and ffpp++ options prepend and append elements to the current font path,
               respectively.  They must be followed by a comma-separated list of entries.

       lleedd     The lleedd option controls the keyboard LEDs.  This controls the turning on or off
               of one or all of the LEDs.  It accepts an optional integer, a preceding dash(-)
               or an 'on/off' flag.  If no parameter or the 'on' flag is given, all  LEDs  are
               turned on.  If a preceding dash or the flag 'off' is given, all LEDs are turned
               off.  If a value between 1 and 32 is given, that LED will be turned on  or  off
               depending  on the existence of a preceding dash.  ``xset led 3'' would turn led
               #3 on.  ``xset -led 3'' would turn it off.  The particular LED values may refer
               to  different  LEDs  on different hardware.  If the X server supports the XKEY‐
               BOARD (XKB) extension, leds may be referenced by  the  XKB  indicator  name  by
               specifying  the  `named' keyword and the indicator name.   For example, to turn
               on the Scroll Lock LED:

               xset led named "Scroll Lock"

       mmoouussee   The mm option controls the mouse parameters; it may be abbreviated  to  'm'.  Of
               course,  it applies to most pointing devices, not just mice. The parameters for
               the pointing device are `acceleration' and `threshold'. The acceleration can be
               specified as an integer, or as a simple fraction. Threshold is just an integer.
               The setting is applied to all connected pointing devices. xinput(1)  should  be
               used if you need device-specific settings.

       By  default  the  pointer (the on-screen representation of the pointing device) will go
       `acceleration' times as fast when the device  travels  more  than  `threshold'  mickeys
       (i.e.  would-be  pixels)  in  10  ms, including a small transition range. This way, the
       pointing device can be used for precise alignment when it is moved slowly, yet  it  can
       be  set  to travel across the screen in a flick of the wrist when desired.  One or both
       parameters for the mm option can be omitted, but if only one is given, it will be inter‐
       preted as the acceleration.  If no parameters or the flag 'default' is used, the system
       defaults will be set.

       If the `threshold' parameter is provided and 0, the `acceleration'  parameter  will  be
       used  in  the exponent of a more natural and continuous formula, giving precise control
       for slow motion but big reach for fast motion, and a progressive transition for motions
       in between.  Recommended `acceleration' value in this case is 3/2 to 3, but not limited
       to that range.

       In the X.org X Server 1.6 and above, the behaviour described so far is  linked  to  the
       default profile. There are other profiles (i.e. functions determining pointer accelera‐
       tion from device velocity) and additional settings, so the above  description  may  not
       apply  to  non-default cases. In the X.org Server 1.7, these are available as input de‐
       vice properties (see xinput).

       pp       The pp option controls pixel color values.  The parameters are the color map en‐
               try  number  in decimal, and a color specification.  The root background colors
               may be changed on some servers by  altering  the  entries  for  BlackPixel  and
               WhitePixel.   Although  these  are  often  0  and 1, they need not be.  Also, a
               server may choose to allocate those colors privately, in which  case  an  error
               will  be  generated.   The map entry must not be a read-only color, or an error
               will result.

       rr       The rr option controls the autorepeat.  Invoking with  "--rr",  or  "rr ooffff",  will
               disable  autorepeat,  whereas "rr", or "rr oonn" will enable autorepeat.  Following
               the "--rr" or "rr" option with an integer keycode between 0 and 255  will  disable
               or  enable  autorepeat on that key respectively, but only if it makes sense for
               the particular keycode.  Keycodes below 8 are not typically valid for this com‐
               mand.  Example: "xxsseett --rr 1100" will disable autorepeat for the "1" key on the top
               row of an IBM PC keyboard.

               If the server supports the XFree86-Misc extension, or the XKB extension, then a
               parameter  of 'rate' is accepted and should be followed by zero, one or two nu‐
               meric values. The first specifies the delay before autorepeat  starts  and  the
               second specifies the repeat rate.  In the case that the server supports the XKB
               extension, the delay is the number of milliseconds  before  autorepeat  starts,
               and  the rate is the number of repeats per second.  If the rate or delay is not
               given, it will be set to the default value.

       ss       The ss option lets you set the screen saver parameters.  This option accepts  up
               to two numerical parameters, a 'blank/noblank' flag, an 'expose/noexpose' flag,
               an 'on/off' flag, an 'activate/reset' flag, or the 'default' flag.  If  no  pa‐
               rameters  or  the 'default' flag is used, the system will be set to its default
               screen saver characteristics.  The 'on/off' flags simply turn the screen  saver
               functions  on  or  off.   The 'activate' flag forces activation of screen saver
               even if the screen saver had been turned off.  The 'reset' flag forces  deacti‐
               vation  of  screen saver if it is active.  The 'blank' flag sets the preference
               to blank the video (if the hardware can do so) rather than display a background
               pattern,  while  'noblank' sets the preference to display a pattern rather than
               blank the video.  The 'expose' flag sets the preference to allow  window  expo‐
               sures  (the  server  can freely discard window contents), while 'noexpose' sets
               the preference to disable screen saver unless the  server  can  regenerate  the
               screens  without causing exposure events.  The length and period parameters for
               the screen saver function determines how long the server must be  inactive  for
               screen  saving  to activate, and the period to change the background pattern to
               avoid burn in.  The arguments are specified in seconds.  If only one  numerical
               parameter is given, it will be used for the length.

       qq       The qq option gives you information on the current settings.

       --vveerrssiioonn
               The --vveerrssiioonn option prints the program version and exits without doing anything
               else.

       These settings will be reset to default values when you log out.

       Note that not all X implementations are guaranteed to honor all of these options.
